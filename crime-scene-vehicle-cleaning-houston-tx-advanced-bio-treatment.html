"description":"After law enforcement has done their work, few people know where to turn for help when a crime has left them with a disturbing mess to clean up at their home or business. But there are professionals, such as the crime scene cleaners at Advanced Bio-Treatment in Houston, who are ready with the skills, experience, products, and equipment needed to return the scene to a clean condition that’s safe for occupants.

Crime scene cleaners do highly specialized work that requires training to ensure complete decontamination and sanitization of all affected areas. Our technicians understand the health risks that may be present at a crime scene, such as airborne and bloodborne pathogens, and know how to identify areas that need decontamination that may not show visible signs of problems.",
